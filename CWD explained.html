<p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">"Core web development" in programming typically refers to the fundamental set of skills and technologies required to create and maintain websites and web applications. It encompasses a range of disciplines and tools essential for building the foundation of web-based projects. Here are some key aspects of core web development:<br>

    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML is the backbone of web development. It is used to structure web content and create the basic layout of web pages. Developers use HTML to define headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, forms, and other elements.<br>
    
    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used to style and format web content created with HTML. It allows developers to control the visual presentation of web pages, including aspects like layout, colors, typography, and responsiveness.<br>
    
    JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. It enables features such as form validation, user interface enhancements, real-time updates, and client-side data manipulation.<br>
    
    Front-End Development: Front-end development focuses on creating the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of websites and web applications. It involves using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build responsive and visually appealing interfaces that interact with users.<br>
    
    Back-End Development: Back-end development involves building the server-side components of web applications. It includes working with server technologies, databases, server-side scripting languages (e.g., Python, Ruby, PHP, Node.js), and frameworks (e.g., Django, Ruby on Rails, Express.js) to handle data storage, business logic, and server communication.<br>
    
    Web Development Frameworks: Frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js are commonly used on the front end to simplify and accelerate web application development. On the back end, frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Laravel, and Express.js provide a structured approach to building server-side components.<br>
    
    Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): Web development often involves integrating with external services and APIs to add functionality to web applications, such as social media logins, payment gateways, mapping services, and more.<br>
    
    Responsive Web Design: Creating websites that work well on a variety of devices and screen sizes is crucial. Responsive web design ensures that web content adapts and looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.<br>
    
    Version Control: Version control systems like Git are essential for tracking changes to code, collaborating with other developers, and managing different versions of a project.<br>
    
    Testing and Debugging: Testing web applications for functionality, performance, and security is a critical part of web development. Debugging tools and practices help identify and fix issues in code.<br>
    
    Web Security: Understanding web security principles and best practices is essential to protect web applications from common vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and data breaches.<br>
    
    Web Hosting and Deployment: Knowledge of web hosting services, server configuration, and deployment methods is necessary to make web applications accessible on the internet.<br>
    
    Core web development skills are foundational for anyone aspiring to become a web developer. However, web development is a constantly evolving field, and developers often need to learn new technologies and best practices to stay up to date with the latest trends and standards.</p>
